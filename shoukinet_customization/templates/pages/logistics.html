Shouki maintain stock of all products. The Typical dispatch time is 2-7 Working days within U.A.E. (We presently accept orders from U.A.E. Clients/Buyers only). A Delivery charge, if applicable, will be presented to you on the checkout page.

If we find the delivery time will take more than 7 working days, we will contact you with a new dispatch time. At that point, if the new delivery time is acceptable to you, we will process the order or you can choose to cancel the order and get your money refunded in the mode of payment it was received by us within 15 days from your request.

We are constantly working to reduce the delivery time with our vendors and will update this page as and when this happens. We will also update this on our social networking profiles so do subscribe to our channels.
